  "DAmainTxt1": "I am a Front-End Developer who loves creating responsive website templates and programming interactive functions. Besides being passionate about designing aesthetically pleasing web pages, I am also capable of concatenating RESTful API data reception update screens. In addition to my professional background in design as well as science and engineering, I also have eight years of experience in web development.",
  "DAmainTxt2": "My affinity towards design and aesthetics has not diminished one bit over the years. Instead, I was further inspired as I developed keener observational skills. This is because critical thinking and creative expression are not confined to existing norms. The joys of creation and aesthetic persistence are where I draw my greatest sense of happiness and achievement. These experiences have also expanded and deepened my horizons.",
